# This action adds all issues and PRs with a "team/fs-wg" label to the FS project board.
# It is used to keep the FS project board up to date with the issues and PRs.
# It is triggered by the issue and PR events.
# It assumes a `FILOZZY_CI_ADD_TO_PROJECT` secret is set in the repo.
# This secret should have the permissions outlined in https://github.com/actions/add-to-project?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-a-pat-and-adding-it-to-your-repository
